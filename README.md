# STOR515FinalProj
Repository containing paper and project code for our STOR515: Dynamic Decision Analytics Final Project on Modeling Food Inventory as MDPs.

Hello! If you're reading this, whether you're Prof. Lassiter (Hi!) or someone stumbling across my GitHub page, welcome to a final project about Markov Decision 
processes and steak!

If you are interested, there is a linked .pdf paper. Additionally, there is an .ipynb file for all of the Python code (version 3.9).
**Should you choose to run it, either get concurrent programming to work -- the threading package was being cumbersome with running the optimality loops, OR open 
  four kernels in Jupyter, copy the codebase file three times, and run each individual MDP call found in the original notebook in its own kernel.**
Expected runtime with concurrent programming (and/or the hack-ish solution)... ~4 hours.
Expected runtime with sequential evaluation... 8. hours.
