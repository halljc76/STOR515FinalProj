# STOR515FinalProj
Repository containing paper and project code for our STOR515: Dynamic Decision Analytics Final Project on Modeling Food Inventory as MDPs.

Hello! If you're reading this, whether you're Prof. Lassiter (Hi!) or someone stumbling across my GitHub page, welcome to a final project about Markov Decision 
processes and steak!

If you are interested, there is a linked .pdf paper. Additionally, there is an .ipynb file for all of the Python code (version 3.9).
**Should you choose to run it, there is a concurrent option that halves the approximate runtime on a normal laptop.**
